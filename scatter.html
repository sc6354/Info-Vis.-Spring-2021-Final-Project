        <h1>Scatter Plot 1 - Relationships Between Attributes (Attribute vs. Attribute)</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Examine the relationships between attributes by selecting the two attributes of your
            choice from the dropdown menus. 
        <br><br>
        The left menu is for the Y-axis, and the right menu is for the X-Axis.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Here is a breakdown of the various attributes you can choose from: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>score</strong> - aka the "Happiness Score"; A metric measured by asking the sampled people the question: "How would you rate your happiness on a scale of 0 to 10 where 10 is the happiest</li>
            <li><strong>logged_gdp_per_capita</strong> - The country's annually calculated logged GDP  per capita</li>
            <li><strong>social_support</strong> - A metric measured by asking the sampled people the question: “If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?” People could only answer yes of no, with yes equal to 1 and no equal to 0</li>
            <li><strong>healthy_life_expectancy</strong> - A metric calculated by the World Health Organization annually for each country's respective estimated healthy life expectancy</li>

            <li><strong>eb_log_gdp_per_capita</strong> - The extent to which GDP contributed to the calculation of the Happiness Score</li>
            <li><strong>eb_social_support</strong> - The extent to which Social Support contributed to the calculation of the Happiness Score</li>
            <li><strong>eb_healthy_life_expectancy</strong> - The extent to which Healthy Life Expectancy contributed to the calculation of the Happiness Score</li>
            <li><strong>eb_freedom_to_make_life_choices</strong> - The extent to which Freedom contributed to the calculation of the Happiness Score</li>
            <li><strong>eb_generosity</strong> - The extent to which Generosity contributed to the calculation of the Happiness Score</li>
